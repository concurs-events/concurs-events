                    <h2>Something About Us</h2>
                    <p class="f-para">There are several ways people can make money online. From selling products to
                        advertising. In this article I am going to explain the concept of contextual advertising.</p>
                    <p>First I will explain what contextual advertising is. Contextual advertising means the advertising
                        of products on a website according to the content the page is displaying. For example if the
                        content of a website was information on a Ford truck then the advertisements would be for Ford
                        trucks for sale, or Ford servicing etc. It picks up the words on the page and displays ads that
                        are similar to those words. Then when someone either performs an action or clicks on your page
                        you will get paid.</p>
